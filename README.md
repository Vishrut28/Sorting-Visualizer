# Sorting-Visualizer
This Python code creates a graphical sorting algorithm visualizer using the Pygame library. Here are its key features:

Visualization: It displays an array as a series of vertical bars, where the height of each bar represents the value of an array element.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: It implements three popular sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort


Interactive Controls: Users can interact with the visualizer using keyboard inputs:

'R' to reset the array with new random values
'B' to start Bubble Sort
'M' to start Merge Sort
'Q' to start Quick Sort


Real-time Visualization: As the sorting algorithms run, the display updates in real-time, showing how elements are compared and swapped.
Color Coding: Different colors are used to highlight the current operations:

Blue for unsorted elements
Red for elements being compared
Green for elements being swapped


User Interface: The visualizer includes a title and on-screen instructions for ease of use.

This code serves as an educational tool, allowing users to visually understand how different sorting algorithms work and compare their performance. It's particularly useful for students learning about algorithms and data structures.
